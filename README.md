## Youtube-Mp3 Converter

This is an simple application that takes in a Youtube link and returns the mp3 version of it. The Node.js server uses a Python script(which in turn uses the YoutubeDL module) to download the video, which is then converted to .mp3 file by using the 'ffmpeg' tool.

This project is done merely for practice, and out of my own interest. 
It is currently in development. If possible, I'd also like to make a React front-end to interact with this.
